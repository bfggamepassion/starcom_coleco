 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 AIM : Your mission is to fly the only space craft available to
 destroy the orbital Space Stations. This is the last chance for the
 people of Earth, for their orbiting masters will never again allow
 them another chance to regain their freedom. You must not fail!
 
 GAMEPLAY : 
 * Pick up barrels to gain extra fuel, indicated on the right of the
  screen.
 * Pick up delta wings to gain extra lves, indicated on the bottom of
  the screen.
 * Pick up bombs and use them to destroy enemy fighters and rockets,
  the number of bombs you have is indicated on the bottom of the screen.
 * Pick up the double-winged craft to gain an extra rear-facing laser,
  indicated by the doors bottom left.
 * Avoid rocks, explosions, other craft and mines. Shoot barrels, ships
  and bombs to destroy them.
 * Use the scanner, top right, to identify the position of the Stations.
 * Shoot the centre of the Space Stations to destroy them. Shooting the
  outside pods does not disable the Stations - be careful of their
  missiles. Destroy all the Space Stations to complete the wave.
 * The condition indicator tells you of any hostile fighters - these
  are also indicated on the scan. The formation indicator tells you
  the exact formation used by the hostile fighters. Use these
  instruments to plan your tactics.
 * When the docking indicator is on, as at the start of the game, you
  may dock with motherships for protection. Picking up the miniature
  motherships turns the indicator off. Docking with the indicator off
  will send you to a different part of the screen.

 NOW : An old fashioned shoot-em-up which is OK for a few minutes...
